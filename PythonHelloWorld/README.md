# Overview
### What I am trying to accomplish as a Software Developer with this program
As a Software Developer, I am working on learning new programming languages quickly and learning programming commands in each language to create new Software. It is customary in career environments to encounter new problems to solve that require critical thinking skills to create efficient software that helps a business thrive and serve people in powerful ways.

### Description of Software

This is a basic program that prints "Hello World! My name is [myName]." It utilizes the variable called myName in the print statement. The software used for this program were Python, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Git. 

### Purpose of this Software

The purpose of this software was to learn how to set up a programming environment and create a simple program. More specifically, the purpose was install the necessary software, write and run a simple program in Python within Visual Studio Code, and push the files to GitHub. 

### Video Demo

This is my my demo video of my programming running.
